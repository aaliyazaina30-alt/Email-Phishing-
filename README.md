#PayPal Phishing Email Overview

## Key Signs of Phishing

- Spoofed sender address: Looks like PayPal but uses a capital “I” instead of “L” (service@paypaI.com).
- Suspicious domain: Slight misspelling to mimic the real domain.
- Deceptive links: Link text appears genuine, but real URL is different and malicious.
- Urgent language: Threatens account deactivation within hours to rush action.
- Request for sensitive info: Asks to confirm credit card details via suspicious link.
- Header issues: Often fails email authentication checks.
- Awkward phrasing: Generic, urgent tone to pressure users.
